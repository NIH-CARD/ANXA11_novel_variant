The requirements file is a general list of most, if not all of the packages required to run this analysis. 
The most complete is the conda_environment.yml file. However, since the versions are extremely specific
they may only function with our computational cluster, and you may need to fit the versions to the nearest
ones supported by your hardware.

This analysis uses Rmarkdown and knitr to create a cache and regulate whether particular code chunks run
and how they are visualized.
